# Welcome!
The Digital Services team works to make HUD's technology more friendly, efficient and easier to use for HUD staff, stakeholder and customers. 
* View our <a href="https://github.com/HUD-Digital-Services/work-with-us/wiki" title="wiki">Wiki page</a> for more information about the work we do.

### We help teams to: 
* validate needs of the citizens you serve to confirm programs are working well for them; 
* identify new ways to bring value to your programs; 
* build and test rough prototypes of additions to improve programs or software that support them; 
* test current or in development software or service delivery; 
* facilitate collaboration and or idea generation workshops with your team or between your team and other offices; 
* write business requirements to ensure the software you want is what gets built.
