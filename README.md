### We help teams to: 
* validate needs of the citizens you serve to confirm programs are working well for them; 
* identify new ways to bring value to your programs; 
* build and test rough prototypes of additions to improve programs or software that support them; 
* test current or in development software or service delivery; 
* facilitate collaboration and or idea generation workshops with your team or between your team and other offices; 
* write business requirements to ensure the software you want is what gets built.
